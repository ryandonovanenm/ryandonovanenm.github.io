_This post was written and published January 19th, 2023, but backdated to put the posts in order._

* I created this blog to share my experiences with “Ethical Non-Monogamy” (ENM). 
    * I want to share about the ways in which it has helped me heal and grow, 
    * the challenges and struggles I’ve faced along the way (as well as the triumphs and joys!), 
    * and even how it has interacted with my faith as a Christian, and my relationship with God.

## Ethical Non-Monogamy


* I like to point out that Non-Monogamy is practiced by a huge portion of the population–just in an _un_ethical way. i.e., lots of people have or are cheating in some way on their partners. Google the statistics on this–they’re staggering.
* Ethical Non-Monogamy, in contrast, is the practice of allowing your partner to have sexual and / or emotional connections and / or relationships with other people, but with full transparency, open communication, and full consent between everyone involved. 
* A Google search suggests that it’s practiced by 4-5% of the population, but I think it’s on the rise since COVID and the “deconstruction” of values and identity that so many people went through as part of that experience (this [Vogue article](https://www.vogue.com/article/the-rise-of-consensual-non-monogamy) has some interesting perspective on that).
* ENM is a minefield, to be sure, and I’ve had to do a ton of self-work and skill-building in order to try and navigate it successfully. 
    * Everyone I’ve met so far who applies the “ENM” label to themself is well aware of this, and very deliberate in how they approach it. 
    * It’s hardly the “wild sex parties” and out-of-control behavior that you might picture.
    * In fact, many of the people I’ve met in it are huge nerds, like myself, that approach it all rather intellectually!


## Polyamory


* I’ve recorded our story over the past year in lots of notes and essentially rough drafts of posts to share.
* I think it’s worth noting, here at the beginning, that there was a significant shift in our values mid-year which changed how I would write about it all today.
* When we started out, we felt strongly that ENM was about opening up sexually, but not romantically. We saw romantic relationships with other partners as a major threat to our marriage, and put boundaries in place to prevent anyone from coming between us. 
* At some point, however, we transitioned to “Polyamory” (literally, “multiple loves”) giving each other consent to have both physical and emotional connection with others. 
    * I wanted to point this out because it means that my values have changed, and so there are undertones to some of my earlier writing that I wouldn’t agree with today. 


* Polyamory is a form of ENM. 
    * While there are many nerds in the ENM space, in my experience Poly is _hugely_ nerdy. 
    * To want to support multiple romantic relationships, you need to be _very_ interested in the topic of how to do relationships well. 
    * This may be largely because we don’t have it modeled for us in our culture, so you need to do a lot of studying to make up for that. 


* Kate and I transitioned to Poly as we began to recognize many of our incompatibilities, and how hard it is for us to meet each other’s relational needs.
* An advantage to Polyamory is that you can have different needs met by different relationships. 
* We saw Poly as a possible way to preserve our marriage despite our incompatibilities, by allowing us to need less from each other.
* Ultimately, it didn’t provide that solution for us, and we recently decided to end our romantic relationship, which I’ll cover in the next post.
    * Kate, in particular, found that she wasn’t as interested as I was in being Poly. 
    * And I strongly suspect (haven’t _quite_ made it there yet) that this big transition in our relationship is really the better choice for us.
