My ENM activity was uncovered recently by my church community. 

I think a major concern around my continued belonging in that community is whether or not Kate or I intend to encourage other Christians towards ENM–to actively “recruit” or evangelize other Christians. 

The short answer is “no, but we will offer information and support to anyone interested”.

She and I have landed in different places around ENM, so there’s a little more to say about it.

**Kate**

Kate’s journey with ENM ultimately gave her access to a wonderful new relationship, and also helped us finally arrive at our separation. 

It achieved those things for her, but she ultimately didn’t come away from it with ENM as her identity, or a desire to continue practicing it, or to join the ENM community.

She is a sex educator, and her aims there are to offer information and support, including to those interested in ENM, but that’s not the same as actively encouraging people towards it.

**Ryan**

For me, ENM and Poly have become key parts of my identity. I’ve found my people there, and that’s the community I hope to pursue in this new stage of my life, post separation from Kate.

Also, one of my highest values and interests in life is to share openly and honestly about my experiences, just as I am on this blog. Even though I’m mostly just sharing, not preaching, so far I’d say ENM has had a very positive impact on my life, so my blog’s hardly “neutral” on the topic. 

I think all of that does make me more of an advocate for it, but I have a hard time picturing myself trying to “rope someone in”. There’s a term in ENM culture for people who behave that way–”Pushy Swingers”. No one likes a pushy swinger. 😝

**Supporting Our Friends**

Kate and I have had the opportunity to support some friends around this topic. They were essentially practicing a light form of ENM, without having that language or familiarity with that concept. It was fun to be able to share with them about Kate and my adventures with ENM, and exciting to have the opportunity to share what we’d learned about how to do it ethically and well.

Ultimately, it wasn’t something they chose to pursue. I had higher hopes that it might be the key to rescuing their relationship, but I’ve come to appreciate the reality that ENM doesn’t really offer that–it can enrich lives and relationships, but it can’t fix the problems in them.
