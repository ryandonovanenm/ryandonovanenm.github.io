A friend sent me this inspiring Instagram [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsjW6jspshn/) by [@solar_punks](https://www.instagram.com/solar_punks/), where ChatGPT describes “a world where the power structures are reversed”. In its response, ChatGPT celebrates the value of emotional intelligence, the wisdom of children, the value of the elderly, and living in harmony with our environment.  
(It was tempting for me to get bogged down in evaluating whether all of the ideas are truly wise–but I think it’s better to just let it be inspiring!)

<script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

To me, these types of ideas are what’s really meant by “the kingdom of God” and Jesus’ offer of “eternal life”. Jesus wanted to guide us toward a world where goodness and love permeate the world and all of human interaction.

## A New, Physical Earth

Something I never picked up on growing up was that, while the Bible does talk about this place called “heaven” that seems to be a more spiritual realm, it’s not actually where we’re intended to spend eternity.

Instead, it talks about God eventually creating a new earth–a new material world–for us to be resurrected back into. New flesh-and-blood bodies that live on solid ground (not clouds 😏), and, again–where goodness and love permeate the world and all of human interaction. 

Even though the Bible uses the language of the old earth “passing away”, and the making of a “new” earth, I think it’s possible that God’s plan isn’t actually to _obliterate_ the Earth and start over, but rather that it’s a continuation of the world we live in today, only healed. 

What I love about this is what it implies about the significance of what you and I do with our lives. It suggests that we’ll be able to trace the impact of the good that God helped us do in this life, because we’re part of an unbroken story that we will one day get to rejoin, and that will continue on into eternity. 

(I picked up the above perspective from reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Called-Create-Biblical-Invitation-Innovate/dp/0801075181) by author Jordan Raynor, who likes to explore the intersection of entrepreneurship and faith).

## Sexuality and Relationships in a New Earth

Since sexuality is a central theme to this site, I figured I’d see what ChatGPT thinks about human sexuality and relationships in this new Earth that God wants us to help create. (And specifically, one that’s defined purely by Biblical principles of love, and setting aside the influence of contemporary Christian religion 😜)

So, ChatGPT–“Describe how human sexual behavior might look in a world where goodness and love permeate the earth and all of human interaction.”, and, of course… “How might this impact relationship structures?”.

The response is just great. You can read it in full [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/78f2a74e-dcb1-495f-8034-c9e7e73af8ed), but here are some highlights: 

* It touches on consent, communication, mutual pleasure, equality, respect, celebration of deliverse bodies, balanced power dynamics in relationships, and wide availability of comprehensive and inclusive sex education, and relationship education. 
* It suggests that “society would be non-judgmental towards different sexual orientations, gender identities, and relationship structures…a safe and inclusive space for all individuals to”:
    * “explore their sexual desires and identities without fear of discrimination…to explore and express their authentic selves”
    * “explore and choose relationship structures that best suit their needs and desires”
    * And to have “Relationship fluidity”, “the freedom to navigate and redefine their relationships based on their evolving needs and desires…without judgment or societal pressure”

_A-fucking-men_.

## Appendix

* Here’s a cheekier framing of the question that produces a similar, shorter response. 😊
    * “In the Biblical notion of a new earth created by God where goodness and love reign over all things and define all of human interaction, how might human sexual behavior and relationship structures look different? Exclude the influence of contemporary Christianity in your response.”
    * Read its’ response [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/5bcaf324-6db2-4052-baa6-a029df0716f2).
* I also asked ChatGPT about whether the Bible says the Earth will be destroyed before being remade, [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/b6f2143a-ff10-41d2-9b10-777eb9f188f8) (short answer: the Bible isn’t clear on it, so both perspectives exist).
* I was initially worried that ChatGPT’s filters would block my “what would sex be like” question, so I started by posing it to an open-source alternative called “Vicuna”. It said similar things, but also touched on a lack of **shame** around sex, and the exploration of **kink** (it gave role-playing and bondage as examples). 🤭
